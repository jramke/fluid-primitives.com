Declare arbitrarily hydration data that should be exposed to the client.

This ViewHelper allows you to define hydration data for like for a component that will be sent to the client for hydration purposes.
The data is registered in the same registry and with the same structure as for component hydration data, so it can be consumed by the same hydration mechanisms.

Example:
```html
<ui:hydrationData name="some-block" props="{someProp: 'someValue', anotherProp: 123}" />
```
